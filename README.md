# TrustlessPilot

We built this to solve 3 problems:
1) Reviews online cannot be trusted, since they have perverse financial incentives and low data volume especially if they are from a small pool of userbase
2) Reviews you see online are not personalized to the individual looking at the reviews
3) Small businesses cannot create their own review systems, since there isn't a preexisting userbase that is verified

To solve this, we built an sdk to make online product reviews more trustworthy and honest. To do this, we tracked reputation of users based on their upvoted reviews in the past plus the review for a given product. Additionally, we used lens protocol to create a personalised viewing experience, weighing reviews more highly when the reviewer is closer to you in your social graph. We also integrated worldcoin to allow users to prove their humanity and give them a higher weight in order to reduce the effect of bot reviews.
